## Run Locally

1. Create a client secret JSON file called `credentials.json` by following these directions: [Create Desktop application credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#desktop). **This will be used by Google Calendar API for authentication.**
3. Run `node app.js`

## Usage Limits

There are usage limits that limits how frequently I can use the Google Calendar API, including the number of events I can create :(
